# Application Policys

## Overview

This Lab is designed to be used after first completing labs A through D and has been created to address how to properly deal with Quality of Service with regard to Catalyst Center. During the lab we will use Application Policies and apply Quality of Service (QoS) within Catalyst Center. We will also discuss, set up and use Controller Based Application Recognition. This allows Network Administrators the ability to configure network devices in an ongoing and programmatic manner from within Catalyst Center to make sure application policies are consistent throughout networks whether using SD-Access or Legacy Network Concepts. This set of concepts requires **Advantage Licensing**.

## General Information

There are a number of hurdles to applying Quality of Service. If we were to read and study the Quality of Service whitepaper we would still have hours of work to determine the correct MQC policies to be deployed for the various linecards and chassis within our network. Catalyst Center allows us to do three things:
1. Update all protocol packs and dynamic URL's used for Application Discovery.
2. Deploy a consistent end-to-end QoS policy.
3. Monitor application usage to assure application and user satisfaction
In order to accomplish this we will discuss all the relevant aspects of these goals along with how we accomplish them in this lab.

## Section 1 - Controller Based Application Recognition

The Application Visibility service lets you manage your built-in and custom applications and application sets. The Application Visibility service, hosted as an application stack within Catalyst Center, lets you enable the **C**ontroller-**B**ased **A**pplication **R**ecognition (CBAR) function on a specific device to classify thousands of network and home-grown applications and network traffic. This allows us to deal with applications beyond the capabilities of NBAR 2 which is some 1400 applications currently. 

![json](./images/CBAR.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

The following packages must be installed and are in the dCLOUD environment:

1. *Application Policy*: Lets you automate QOS policies across LAN, WAN, and wireless within your campus and branch.
2. *Application Registry*: Lets you view, manage, and create applications and application sets.
3. *Application Visibility Service*: Provides application classification using Network-Based Application Recognition (NBAR) and CBAR techniques.

The Day-N Application Visibility page provides a quick view of application registry, device recognition method, device CBAR readiness, application observed in the network for the past 2, 24, or 48 hours, and CBAR health.

The Application Visibility service lets Catalyst Center connect with external authoritative sources like Cisco's NBAR Cloud, Infoblox or the Microsoft Office 365 Cloud Connector to help classify the unclassified traffic or help generate improved signatures. Through CBAR we can discover applications from sources such as Cisco's NBAR Cloud, Infoblox, or Microsofts 0365 and catagorize them for use on our network. Additionally, unclassified traffic can come from any flow that the CBAR-enabled device identifies but that is not recognized by the NBAR engine. In such cases, the applications that have a meaningful bit rate are reported as unclassified and can be imported and used as applications within application sets within Catalyst Center.

![json](./images/CBAR-Sources.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

As the number of applications is always changing and protocol packs are always being updated we can keep those current on the network through CBAR as well. Visibility sometimes can be lost from end-to-end with outdated protocol packs whcih do not allow some application to be correctly recognized which can cause not only visibility holes within the network but also incorrect queuing or forwarding issues. CBAR solves that issue by allowing the push of updated protocl packs across the network.

Lets get started.

### Step 1 - Enabling Controller Based Application Recognition

The first step will be to enable the CBAR service. During the course of this operation we will enable CBAR on the switch, as well as instantiate feeds and connect with external authoritative sources at Cisco and Microsofts 0365.

1. Navigate to the **Application Visibility** within Catalyst Center through the menu **`Provision > Services > Application Visibility`**.

   ![json](./images/DNAC-CBAR-Navigation.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

2. In the Application Visibility page, click **Next**. 

   ![json](./images/DNAC-CBAR-Enable.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

3. A pop-up window for enabling the Application Visibility service appears. Click **Yes** in the pop-up window to enable CBAR on Catalyst Center.

   ![json](./images/DNAC-CBAR-Enable.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

4. Check the Enable CBAR on all Ready Devices check box or choose the switch within CBAR Readiness Status in Ready state. Click Next to enable CBAR on the devices.

   ![json](./images/DNAC-CBAR-EnableDevice.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

5. We will now configure the external authoritative sources:

   #### NBAR Cloud

   1. First we will connect to Cisco's **NBAR Cloud**.

      1. Select **Configure** under **NBAR Cloud**. Then click the **Cisco API Console** to configure the connection on the Cisco side. This is a required step for previous versions of Catalyst Center before **2.3.7.6**

         ![json](./images/DNAC-CBAR-NBARCLOUD-Enable.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

      2. Fill in the fields from the API Application created on **Cisco API Console**

          ![json](./images/DNAC-CBAR-NBARCLOUD.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

      <details closed>
      <summary> Expand section for Cisco API Console Instructions if required </summary></br>

         1. A new browser tab should open after authentication to the **Cisco API Console**. This allows you to configure multiple connections to various API services within Cisco. Click **Register a New App**

            ![json](./images/DNAC-NBARCLOUDAPI.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

         2. On the next page name your **Application** which in our case will be `DCLOUD DNAC` and add a description if desired

            ![json](./images/DNAC-NBARCLOUD-1.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

         3. Scroll down and **select all the checkboxes** including the **acceptance of terms** and click the **Register** button

            ![json](./images/DNAC-NBARCLOUD-2.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

         4. A success page should appear. Click the **My Keys & Apps** link within it.

            ![json](./images/DNAC-NBARCLOUD-SUCCESS.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

         5. You will then select the *Application* tab and from it the **Application Name**, as well as the **Key** and the **Client Secret** and one by one copy them into the previous window

            ![json](./images/DNAC-NBARCLOUD-SVC.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

         6. Ensure that the Service is **Enabled** that the **Client ID** AKA **Key** is entered along with the **Client Secret**. Additionally enter the **Organization Name** aka the **Application** and click **Save**.

            ![json](./images/DNAC-CBAR-NBARCLOUD_SETTINGS.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

      </details>

   #### MS Office O365 Cloud

   1. To Enable the MS Office 365 Cloud connector enable the selector switch

      ![json](./images/DNAC-CBAR-0365.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

   2. Click Yes on the popup to enable the connection and click **Finish** to finish enabing the service

      ![json](./images/DNAC-CBAR-0365-YES.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

5. At this point CBAR application will display.

   ![json](./images/DNAC-CBAR.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

### Step 2 - Updating Protocol Packs

Within the CBAR Application, we will now review the way the devices will be updated. **Auto-Updatee** feature was added to Catalyst Center prior to **2.3.5.6** and so this allows for devices to automatically be updated for **NBAR** protocol packs by Catalyst Center. 

1. While Devices may be **Auto-Updated** you can see from the picutre below that when **Auto-Update** is disabled you can push Protocol Packs individually.

   ![json](./images/DNAC-Device-Update.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

2. The ISR 4331 Router however is not enabled at the moment for **CBAR**. Lets remedy this now. Click the **WAN Interfaces** link to indicate the **WAN** Interface on the router.

   ![json](./images/DNAC-Device-Update.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

3. On the WAN Connectivity Settings Page, Select **`GigabitEnternet0/0/0`** as the **WAN** interface as shown and **Save** the settings. Here you can specify a **Service Provider Profile** if set as well as sub rate interfaces. We will not do this in the lab.

   ![json](./images/DNAC-CBAR-ISR-WAN.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

4. Select the check box next to eht **isr4331** and click the **Enable CBAR** link to finish the configuration of **CBAR** for the ISR.

   ![json](./images/DNAC-CBAR-ISR-WAN-Enable-CBAR.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

5. Click **Yes** to continue.

   ![json](./images/DNAC-CBAR-ISR-WAN-Enable-CBAR-1.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

6. Click **Next** to continue.

   ![json](./images/DNAC-CBAR-ISR-WAN-Enable-CBAR-2.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

7. Click **Enable** to continue.

   ![json](./images/DNAC-CBAR-ISR-WAN-Enable-CBAR-3.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

6. Verify **All Devices**.

   ![json](./images/DNAC-CBAR-ISR-WAN-Enable-CBAR-4.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

## Section 2 - Building and Deploying an Application Policy

The Application Policy methodology within Catalyst Center allows for two types of policies to be constructed, wired and wireless. During this section we will build and deploy an Application Policy for a wired environment.

### Step 1 - Build Application Policy Draft

1. Navigate to **Application Policy** within Catalyst Center through the menu *Policy>Application*.

   ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicyNavigate.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

2. In the Application Policy page, click **Add Policy**. 

   ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicy-0-Start.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

3. Enter `CATC-Template-Lab` as the name for the Application Policy Name.

   ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicy-1-Name.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

   #### Site to Apply Policy

4. Click the **Site** and then on the popup on the right click **Edit Scope**

   ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicy-2-Site.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

5. Put a tick next to *Floor 1*. Click **Save**  

   ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicy-3-SiteEdit.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

6. Please note that the gear icon you may have noticed on the right of the floor allows access to either exclude devices or interfaces from the QoS Policy should it be required. 

   ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicy-4-SiteExclude.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

   #### Queuing Policy to Apply

7. Click the **CVD_QUEUING_PROFILE** link to open the Queuing Profile Editor.

   ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicy-5-Queue.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

8. If you wished to deviate from the CVD Queuing Profile you could click **Add Profile**

   ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicy-6-QueueCVD.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

9. Within the Queuing Profile Editor you would name the new profile and then adjust the sliders to set your queuing policy. Once complete you would click **Select** to use that policy. We will not deviate from the CVD standard at this time so click **Cancel**.

   ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicy-7-QueueCustom.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

   #### Host Tracking

10. Click the **Host Tracking Slider** to allow for QoS policy to work with endpoint mobility. When host tracking is turned on, Catalyst Center tracks the connectivity of the collaboration endpoints within the site scope and automatically reconfigures the ACL entries when the collaboration endpoints connect to the network or move from one interface to another. 

    ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicy-8-Tracking.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

   #### Saving Draft Policy

11. At this point we could save a copy of the Application Policy by selecting the three dots beside Deploy a pop up menu will appear.

    ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicy-8.5-Menu.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

12. Click **Save Draft** from the pop up menu 

    ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicy-9-SaveDraft.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

### Step 2 - Deploying Application Policy

   #### Preview Policy

   ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicy-8.5-Menu.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

2. Click **Preview** on the popup menu to preview the policy.

   ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicy-10-PreviewStart.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

3. Click **Generate** on the popup on the right to generate the policy.

   ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicy-11-PreviewGenerate.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

4. Click **View** on the popup on the right to view the policy.

   ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicy-12-PreviewView.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

5. Take a look at the policy in the popup on the right.

   ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicy-13-Preview.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

   #### Deploy Policy

6. Click the **Deploy** and click **Yes** on the pop up that will appear.

   ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicy-14-Deploy.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

7. Click the **Apply** on the pop up on the right that will appear. You could alternatively schedule this task.

   ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicy-15-Apply.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

8. Another pop up will appear with the word *configuring* to symbolize the policy push.

   ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicy-16-Configuring.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

9. The word *Success* should be displayed shortly after to symbolize the policy has been pushed. Click the Success link to view the deployed policy.

   ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicy-17-Success.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

10. Another pop up will appear with the deployed policy which has been pushed.

    ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicy-18-DeployedPolicy.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

11. After closing the popups you will notice two elements in the Application Policy page. The Draft Policy which can be reused and the Policy as pushed to the site..

    ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicy-19-DraftAndPolicy.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

At this point you have successfully pushed a CVD QoS Policy to the network.

## Lab Section 3 - Building and Deploying a Custom Application

At this point you have successfully built and deployed a custom Application within a QoS Policy.

## Automating Application Policies

While it is possible to click through these processes manually, which can be time-consuming, we can handle this differently. We may automate them further via REST API.

## Summary

The next step will be to build Enable Telemetry in the network infrastructure.
