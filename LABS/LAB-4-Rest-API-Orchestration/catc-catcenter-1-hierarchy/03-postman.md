# Postman and External Data Sources

Within Postman, we will utilize the collection `Build Hierarchy` to build out the Hierarchy of Catalyst Center into which we associate `settings` and `discover devices`. 

This Collection may be run whenever you wish to create a new section of the Hierarchy to **add** additional `Areas`, `Buildings`, or `floors`. 

Accompanying the Collection is a **required** Comma Separated Value (CSV) file, which is essentially an `answer file` for the values used to build the design which we have previously edited. 

You will have already modified the 3rd line of the **CSV** with the correct POD information with the following: 

So it looks like this but for your **POD** specific information.
