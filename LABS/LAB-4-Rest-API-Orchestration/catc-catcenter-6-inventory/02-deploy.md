## Summary

We have run a collection against Catalyst Center to retrieve the device inventory and can export that to a file within our host. 

This information might be used for many uses, including making decisions on template deployment, SWIM upgrades, etc. The limits of what can be done from here on are only those of your imagination.

> **Note**: Additionally, if there is time, look at the pre and post-scripts within Postman.
