# Preparing Postman for use with Catalyst Center

To use Postman with Catalyst Center, we import the collection and environment into our workspace.

## Postman Collection and Environment Import

To prepare Postman for the lab, please download the following collection and environment zip file and upload them into Postman. Download the following Student Collection, which includes seven collections and one environment. To do this right, click and open this link in a new tab to download them:

> **Download**: <a href="https://git-link.vercel.app/api/download?url=https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES/blob/master/CODE/POSTMAN/DEVNET-IGNITE/CatalystCenter-UseCase-API-Collection.zip" target="_blank">⬇︎ Catalyst Center Use-Case API Collection ⬇︎</a>

After you download the file, uncompress the compressed files and import all the files into Postman.

Follow these steps:

1. Click on the Postman shortcut on the desktop.

## Postman Environment Variables

Next, set up the client with the correct environment variables and SSL settings.

To ensure uniformity across all calls made from the client when we use different collections, we use Environmental Variables. These variables form a database that can be used in many collections. Also, the variables enable you to build specific collections for many functions to devote them to specific use cases.

1. Navigate to the environment on the left sidebar.

2. Hover over the environment in the list. Notice a box to set it to **Active**.

3. Select the check box.

> **Note**: This environment is pre-populated with the information to build Catalyst Center. At specific points in the lab, we will **customize** it for **your use**.

## SSL Settings and Disabling Validation

For Lab purposes, Catalyst Center uses a self-signed certificate. This certificate may fail a validation precheck. Disable this setting to proceed with the Lab.

1. Click the Settings gear icon on the top right of Postman.
