# Introduction to REST API and Postman

This set of Cisco Learning Labs is developed around a set of simple use cases to show both the power of Catalyst Center, the APIs, and easy methodologies for execution through Postman.

These Labs are designed for the Cisco DCLOUD - Catalyst Center pods for DevNet Test Drives Lab. It was developed for a Lab, which includes Catalyst Center 2.3.5.4 and equipment running at least 17.x versions of code.

## Use Case Lab Approach

These Labs are organized as use cases, and each use case has an associated API Collection.

1. Building a Hierarchy
2. Defining Settings and Credentials
3. Device Discovery
4. Deploying Projects and Templates
5. Downloading Configuration Archives
6. Retrieving Network Inventory
7. Running Show Commands
