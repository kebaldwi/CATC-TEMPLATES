# Template Deployment

We will now `deploy` a template within a Project with your Area Name within Catalyst Centers template editor.

Follow these steps:

## Open the Collection Runner

Navigate and open the desired collection runner:

   1. Within Postman, click on the collection shortcut in the sidebar
   2. Hover over the collection `Catalyst Center API LAB 302 - Template Deployment`
   3. Click the `Run Collection` submenu option

      ![Open Collection Runner](./assets/Postman-Collection-DeployTemplate.png?raw=true)

## Run the Collection

To run the collection, follow these steps:

   1. Locate the sub-components of the `Runner`
   2. On the right under data, click *select* 
   3. Browse and select the CSV using explorer
   4. Click Open to select the file to be used
   5. Optionally select the `Save Responses` option

## Verifying Template Deployment

To verify that the template was deployed successfully, we will inspect the template editor within Catalyst Center.

Follow these steps:

1. If Catalyst Center is not already open, use a browser and navigate to `https://198.18.129.100`, where you may see an SSL Error displayed as depicted. Click the `Proceed to https://192.18.129.100 (unsafe)` link to continue if presented

2. If required, log into Catalyst Center using the username of `admin` and the password `C1sco12345`.

4. Select `Tools>Template Editor` from the menu to continue.

5. Expand the Project with your Area Name on the left to show your specific Project with the template, then select it and view it on the right.

## Summary

We have been able to deploy a template within a project inside Catalyst Centers template editor. 

This scenario may be augmented and modified to use imported files within Postman to allow for a more dynamic approach. The flow allows us to rapidly stage Projects and Templates, perhaps importing them from GitHub in the CICD pipeline. 

> **Note**: If there is time, look at the pre and post-scripts within Postman and look at the additionally included Deploy Template API and perhaps run it.
