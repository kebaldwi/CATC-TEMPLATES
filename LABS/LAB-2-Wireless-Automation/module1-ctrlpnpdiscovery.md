# Wireless Controller Discovery or PnP

Within this lab module, we will concentrate our efforts on the discovery or PnP of each of the devices by **Catalyst Center**, so that we can onboard and gain management of those devices. 

Within this lab we will concentrate on the following which are typical in most Enterprise Networks today:

1. Controller Discovery
2. Access Point switch port configuration
3. Access Point Onboarding

To begin lets review the wireless within the Cisco DCLOUD environment.

### Required Components 

For these labs we will be focusing on the wireless aspects, and while the switching and routing has been setup ahead of time our focus will be on the following:

Virtual Machines:

    Catalyst Center 2.3.5.6 or better
    Identity Services Engine (ISE) 3.0 Patch 4 or better (deployed)
    Wireless LAN Controller - C9800 running IOS-XE Bengaluru 17.5.1 code or better
    Windows 10 Jump Host 
    Windows Server 2019 - Can be configured to provide identity, DHCP, DNS, etc.
    Windows 10 Clients

Hardware Devices:

    Catalyst 9300 Switch - 17.06.01 IOS-XE Code with Embedded Wireless Controller (EWC) and ThousandEyes Enterprise Agent
    9130AX Access Points
    Silex Controllers (3 Wired NIC's and 1 Wireless NIC)

### Logical Topology

The lab envionment that is available is depicted here:

For routing in the environment an OSPF IGP process has been created to propogate internal route information. Within the access switches which are connected at Layer 3 to the router, we have estansiated a layer 2 port channel between them and initiated various vlans for Access Point connectivity and for the clients, whose gateway is built on an HSRP instance shared between the two switches.

The 9130AX Access Points are connected to both access switches and the ports are automatically configured via the AUTOCONF feature.

## Lab Section 1 - Controller Discovery

To get started with Wireless configuration and automation we first need to onboard the Wireless Controller into Catalyst Center. In the preparation lab we discovered the rest of the topology, set up the required services, and so we will now concentrate her on the controller. 

While we have the ability to PnP a Wireless Controller typically these are estantiated initially with IP information on the physical hardware. As a result, and because of the current liimitations within the DCLOUD lab, we will concentrate on Discovery methods here. We will cover Controller PnP separately in another module (TBD).

### Step 1 - ***Setup Discovery Job***

1. Open a web browser on the Windows Workstation Jump host. Open a connection to Catalyst Center and select the hamburger menu icon to open the menu. Select `Tools>Discovery`.

   ![json](./images/module1-pnpdiscovery/dnac-navigation-discovery.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

2. On the Discovery page click `Add Discovery`.

   ![json](./images/module1-pnpdiscovery/dnac-discovery-dashboard.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

      1. Click **CLI**
      2. Hover over the **Add CLI Credential** link
      3. In the sub menu select **Global** to add the credential to the Global store.
