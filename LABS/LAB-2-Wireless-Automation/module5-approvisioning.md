# Wireless Access Point Provisioning

Within this lab module, we will concentrate our efforts on the PnP of each of the access points by **Catalyst Center**, so that we can onboard and gain management of those devices. 

Within this lab we will concentrate on the following which are typical in most Enterprise Networks today:

1. DHCP Address Scope
2. Catalyst Center Discovery
3. Access Point switch port configuration
4. Access Point Onboarding

To begin lets review the wireless within the Cisco DCLOUD environment.

## Required Components 

For these labs we will be focusing on the wireless aspects, and while the switching and routing has been setup ahead of time our focus will be on the following:

Virtual Machines:

    Catalyst Center 2.3.5.6 or better
    Identity Services Engine (ISE) 3.0 Patch 4 or better (deployed)
    Wireless LAN Controller - C9800 running IOS-XE Bengaluru 17.5.1 code or better
    Windows 10 Jump Host 
    Windows Server 2019 - Can be configured to provide identity, DHCP, DNS, etc.
    Windows 10 Clients

Hardware Devices:

    Catalyst 9300 Switch - 17.06.01 IOS-XE Code with Embedded Wireless Controller (EWC) and ThousandEyes Enterprise Agent
    9130AX Access Points
    Silex Controllers (3 Wired NIC's and 1 Wireless NIC)

## Logical Topology

The lab envionment that is available is depicted here:

For routing in the environment an OSPF IGP process has been created to propogate internal route information. Within the access switches which are connected at Layer 3 to the router, we have estansiated a layer 2 port channel between them and initiated various vlans for Access Point connectivity and for the clients, whose gateway is built on an HSRP instance shared between the two switches.

The 9130AX and or 4800 Access Points are connected to both access switches and the ports are automatically configured via the AUTOCONF feature.

# Lab Section 1 - Access Point PnP

In the preparation lab we discovered the rest of the topology, set up the required services, and part of those services were DHCP addresses which are help within scopes on the Windows AD Server. 

There are a few options for discovery using PnP. These were thoroughly discussed in the switching section and in a tutorial in the main menu. 

## Background 

In order to land on Catalyst Center though the device needs help in finding it. 

The PnP components are as follows:

![json](./images/module3-approvisioning/pnp-workflows.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

There are 3 automated methods to make that occur:

1. **DHCP with option 43**
```
   PnP string: 5A1D;B2;K4;I198.18.129.100;J80 added to DHCP Server
``` 
2. **DNS lookup**
``` 
   pnpserver.pnp.dcloud.cisco.com resolves to Catalyst Center VIP Address
```
3. **Cloud re-direction https://devicehelper.cisco.com/device-helper**
   **which, re-directs to on-prem Catalyst Center IP Address**

**Option 1:** requires that along with the IP address and gateway the DHCP server must offer a PnP string via option 43. This option is often used with Cisco wireless so you may want to incorporate option 60 and the use of vendor specific information to ensure the correct controller is referenced for the device in question. 

**Option 2:** requires that along with the IP address and gateway the DHCP server offer the domain suffix that the **pnpserver** record will reside in and a name server to resolve the address. Caveats here would be that if not all devices were to be landing on Catalyst Center then you may need sub domains.

**Option 3:** requires that along with the address and gateway the DHCP server offer a name server to resolve the address of **device-helper.cisco.com**. Additionally it requires the that Catalyst Center register a file with the PnP Connect portal which it will offer via SSL to a device which reaches out. In order to whitelist those devices, the serial number would have to be associated to the DNAC profile within software centrals pnp connect portal.

![json](./images/module3-approvisioning/pnp-connect.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

Once one of the options has been built devices will get the address and be pointed to and land on Catalyst Center within the PnP Device list.

## Step 1 - ***DHCP as a Discovery Method***

DHCP services are important to understand primarily because along with the address and the gateway for connectivity is assigned option 43 which primes or directs the Cisco Access Point towards **Catalyst Center** or typically a **Wireless Controller**.

![json](./images/module1-pnpdiscovery/dhcp-lab-scope.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

Within the Scopes is a scope for the Access Point Vlan, aptly named *APVLAN* and within that you will see option 43 defined which is given to all clients within the scope.

![json](./images/module1-pnpdiscovery/dhcp-apvlan-option43.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

## Step 2 - ***Access Point Port Configuration***

The second part of the PnP equation is setting the environment up to allow for the device to get the address in question. This was previously accomplished in the setup procedure of the lab utilizing a template which was auto provisioned to the switch after discovery.

The Switch was configured to automatically configure switch ports with connected Access Points with the following configuration. This was accomplished through **AUTOCONF** as explained in previous labs 7 and 8.

This is only one way of accomplishing this task, many others can be used, as was proven out in lab 8, with zero trust environment, and change of authorization being the catalyst for deploying an `interface template`.

In this lab as we are focusing on Wireless, the port configuration was automatically assigned via **AUTOCONF** for simplicity.

The switch port configuration used in this lab is:

```
c9300-1#sh der int gi 1/0/2
  Building configuration...
  
  Derived configuration : 261 bytes
  !
  interface GigabitEthernet1/0/2
   description Access Point Interface
   switchport access vlan 999
   switchport trunk native vlan 10
   switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30,40,999
   switchport mode trunk
   spanning-tree portfast
   spanning-tree bpduguard enable
  end
```

## Step 3 - ***Access Point Reset***

The Access Points are typically in varied states. Use the DCLOUD UI to console into each one then complete the following steps to clear them of any configuration:

1. Login to the Access Point with the following credentials: 
   - Username: `Cisco`
   - Password: `Cisco`
2. Enter privileged mode by issuing the command `enable`
3. when prompted for the enable password use the following credential:
   - Enable Password: `Cisco`
4. At the command prompt issue the following command, `capwap ap erase all`
5. When prompted enter at the `[confirm]` prompt.
6. The AP will clear its config and reboot.
7. After a few moments have passed check the PnP Claim page and the AP should be in the list.

   ![json](./images/module3-approvisioning/dnac-pnp-ap-unclaimed.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

At this point of the process the Access Points should appear in the PnP Claim window.

## Step 4 - ***Access Point Claim***

1. Open a web browser on the Windows Workstation Jump host. Open a connection to Catalyst Center and select the hamburger menu icon to open the menu. Select **`Provision > Network Devices > Plug and Play`**.
