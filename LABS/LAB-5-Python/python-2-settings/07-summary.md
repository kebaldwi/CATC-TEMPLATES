# Summary

At this point, we have built the Hierarchy, Settings and Credentials, utilizing variables and REST-API's within the Python programs via **CI/CD**. Now the great part is that if you left the job running it would always monitor that file and update what it needed to when it occurred. 

Obviously, there is a time and place for changes, but automating the entire build of the Hierarchy with Settings and Credntials is extremely powerful. 

Wait till you see whats next...

To continue your learning, look at the various REST-API's used to complete this task.
