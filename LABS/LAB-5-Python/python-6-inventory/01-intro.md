# Inventory Retrieval

In this module, we will use a **CI/CD Pipeline** to **retrieve** the Cisco Catalyst Center **inventory** as well as **compliance** data. 

## Inventory Background

Cisco Catalyst Center uses hierarchy to logically align intent (code and configuration) against infrastructure. This allows the network administrator to align changes and modifications to the network within maintenance windows. It also keeps track of the configurations, runs compliance checks and maintains a list of software and PSIRT compliance lists against both hardware and software.

In this lab, we will **retrieve** the device **inventory** as well as **compliance** information.
