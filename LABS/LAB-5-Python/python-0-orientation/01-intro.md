# Introduction to Python with Cisco Catalyst Center

This set of Cisco Learning Labs is developed to help illustrate the ability to utilize **Python** to orchestrate Cisco Catalyst Center. In an ever changing and demanding world we have constant changes in platforms, software and demands placed on both the network and delivery teams to execute. 

## Overview

In this lab we will use a set of simple use cases to show both the power of Cisco Catalyst Center, REST APIs, and easy methodologies for execution through a Python.

These Labs are designed for the Cisco dCloud - Enterprise Network Sandbox Lab. It was developed in version 4.1, which includes Cisco Catalyst Center 2.3.5.7 and equipment running at least 17.x versions of code.

## Cisco Catalyst Center

Cisco Catalyst Center is an intelligent Automation and Assurance platform for the campus. Cisco Catalyst Center enables, simplified Day-0 through Day-N management of switching, routing, and wireless infrastructure. It also improves operations with AI/ML-enhanced analytics to streamline troubleshooting and provide actionable insights into the health of the network and the quality of experience for users and applications. Here are some of the capabilities of Cisco Catalyst Center in their respective domains:

* NetOps: Network Plug and Play for Zero Touch Deployment, Software Image Management, Compliance, Configuration Templates and Network Profiles, Model-Driven Configuration, and RMA Support.
* AIOps: AI/ML-enhanced monitoring and troubleshooting support. Predictive Insights, Network Baselines, Network Reasoner, Device/Client/Application 360, Intelligent Capture.
* SecOps: AI Endpoint Analytics, Group-Based Policy and Analytics, Software-Defined Access
* DevOps: ITSM Integrations, APIs, SDK & Ansible Module 

## Use Case Lab Approach

These Labs are organized as use cases, and each use case has an associated API Collection.

1. Building a Hierarchy
2. Defining Settings and Credentials
3. Device Discovery
4. Deploying Projects and Templates
5. Retrieving Network Inventory

## Prerequisites

To effectively run the Labs, install the following tools on your computer:
