# Summary

At this point, we have built the Hierarchy, utilizing variables and REST-API's within the Python programs via **Python**. You could if you wanted to track the changes in a **Pipeline** to the CSV file and then re run the **Python Program** to add new elements. 

Obviously, there is a time and place for changes, but automating the entire build of the Hierarchy is extremely powerful. 

Wait till you see whats next... In the next part of the lab we will deploy settings and credentials to the newly added elements of the hierarchy.

To continue your learning, look at the various REST-API's used to complete this task.
