# Summary

At this point, we have built the Hierarchy, deployed the Settings and Credentials, and discovered devices within the network and imported them into Cisco Catalyst Center. We have been utilizing variables and REST-API's within the Python programs via **Python**. You could if you wanted to track the changes in a **Pipeline** to the CSV file and then re run the **Python Program** to add new elements. 

Obviously, there is a time and place for changes, but automating the entire build of the Hierarchy is extremely powerful. 

Wait till you see whats next... In the next part of the lab we will deploy templates within our network and add them to the newly added elements of the hierarchy.

To continue your learning, look at the various REST-API's used to complete this task. 

> **Note:** We have discovered devices within the network and imported them into Cisco Catalyst Center. This scenario may be augmented and modified to create a brownfield learn, which would allow the provisioning of a template to normalize AAA settings and then assign the device to a site for provisioning. This may assist in brownfield learning so as to ensure the device may be properly provisioned with the UI based settings for intent.
