# Summary

We have discovered devices within the network and imported them into Cisco Catalyst Center. This scenario may be augmented and modified to create a brownfield learn, which would allow the provisioning of a template to nullify AAA settings and then assign the device to a site for provisioning.

This may assist in brownfield learning so as to ensure the device may be properly provisioned with the UI based settings for intent.
