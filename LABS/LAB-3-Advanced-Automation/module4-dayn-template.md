## Overview

This Module is designed and built to address how to use DayN templates within Cisco Catalyst Center to configure network devices at Day 1 through N. This Lab is designed to be used after first completing the previous modules. 

The purpose of DayN templates is to allow for **ongoing configuration** of features on devices beyond those deployed on the Claiming process. With Cisco Catalyst Center, if devices are not within a fabric, the host onboarding part of the UI will not be available. To that end, templates are an easy way of deploying those types of configuration and much more. Before starting this Lab, please make sure you have finished all the steps in the previous modules.

## Considerations about Templates

* PnP vs. DayN Templates: Cisco recommends using DayN Templates for most configurations, reserving PnP templates for establishing a stable network connection.

* Inventory Database Limitations: The inventory database is inaccessible before the claim process, complicating onboarding. This results in a need for manual input in scripts instead of leveraging known device information.

* Ongoing Modifications: DayN operations templates are stored within a project, while onboarding templates are located in the project Onboarding Configuration. Using onboarding templates post-PnP is impractical due to the absence of **system** and **bind** variables, which could simplify code and reduce repetition.

* Automation Potential: DayN templates facilitate ongoing modifications and automate configurations using data from the inventory database, minimizing manual input.

* Configuration Best Practices: Typical configurations should automatically derive from the Network Settings in Cisco Catalyst Center. Avoid deploying CLI code in templates for tasks already defined by design components, promoting a more UI-centric and maintainable configuration approach.

* Guidance: Utilize design settings for as much configuration as possible, keeping templates streamlined for configurations that may change frequently, enhancing maintainability and troubleshooting.

* **Jinja** vs **Velocity**, choose wisely. My recommendation is to use Jinja simply because it is the defactor template rendering language used in multiple platforms. It is modular, and the logic consrtucts are based on **Python**. 

## Developing a DayN Template

So what should be in the DayN Templates? Well that depends on the situation, but generally speaking we need to build the onboarding capability of the device, and put that which cannot change without disrupting the communication from Device to Catalyst Center.

Additionally, while a more extensive set of settings can be built out for deployment, we will limit the configuration to the **minimum** necessary to perform this step, building off the completed tasks in module 2.

You can create Regular Day N Templates using Jinja2 and Velocity scripting languages within the **Template Hub** within **Cisco Catalyst Center**. There are two basic types of templates we can utilize. **Regular** templates, as well as **Composite** templates. Use a combiination of these templates to adhere to the **DRY** philosophy.

### Regular Templates

**Regular** templates are templates which are typically designed to address a specific use case. Regular templates are written in either Jinja2 or Velocity scripting languages. Each Language has features which may be leveraged to make the script more reusable, allowing the user to not have to repeat themselves. This modular capability allows us to keep a script written to address a specific need small. At the same time each form of scripting language allows for features like variables, conditional logic, and looping constructs. This allows for a small powerful script to be written making it more light weight and easier to fault find and maintain.

### Composite Templates

**Composite** templates are logical templates used for grouping together multiple **Regular** templates. They allow you to use Jinja2 and Velocity **Regular** templates within the same logical template. This allows us to make templates in mutliple languages and to be able to reuse long standing Velocity scripts with newer Jinja2 templates within the same **Composite** Template. This allows for people to code in the language they are more accustomed too, and to continue to support existing scripts.

### Included items:

* System Configuration
  * Hostname
  * System MTU 
  * VTP 
  * Enable Netconf 
* Management Interface Configuration
  * IP address
  * Subnet Mask
  * Source Management Traffic
* Next Hop Configuration
  * Gateway or Routing Protocol

## Exercises

This section will go through the build and provisioning of **Composite** and **Regular** templates via Cisco Catalyst Center to a Catalyst 9k switch. We will deal with the **Greenfield** scenario only during this module. Remember that a similar approach could be used for **Brownfield**.

### Step 1 - Navigate to Template Hub

Navigate to the CLI Template Hub on Catalyst Center **`Tools > Template Hub`**

### Step 2 - Create a Project

We will create a **Project** for the deployment of these switches within the lab. You may notice that there is a Project which was deployed during the lab preparation module. We will not be utilizing that here, but you could if you desired.
