# ISE Certificate Setup (via GUI)

## Overview

In this lab module, we will setup ISE certificates via the GUI.  While this is an effective setup for a small deployment of ISE nodes, for larger deployments it is recommended to automate this task using a programmatic approach and the available ISE APIs.

## General Information

>[!WARNING]
>You must have completed [**PKI Infrastructure Setup Module**](./01-PKI-Infrastructure.md) before completing this lab module.

>[!NOTE]
>:mega: If you have already done these steps via the API in the [**03b-ISE-API**](./03b-ISE-API.md), the certificates you generated will need to be deleted first.<br><br>
>:mega: While many of these tasks can be completed with your own device, the screenshots taken (and many of the steps reference) using the Windows Jump Host.  

This lab module consists of the following tasks:

   1. [**Exporting Windows Root CA Certificate**](#exporting-the-windows-root-ca-certificate)
   2. [**Installing the Root CA in ISE**](#installing-the-root-ca-in-ise)
   3. [**Generating a Certificate Signing Request**](#generating-a-certificate-signing-request)
   4. [**Signing the ISE CSR with the Certificate Authority**](#signing-the-ise-csr-with-certificate-authority)
   5. [**Binding the CSR with the Certificate**](#binding-the-csr-with-the-certificate)


## Exporting the Windows Root CA Certificate

>[!NOTE]
>If you have completed the certificate export as part of the [***02-Catalyst-Center module***](./02-Catatlyst-Center.md) (as part of this same lab slot)- you do not need to export the CA cert again as long as it is in Base 64 format.

***Complete the following tasks:***

1. From the Windows Jump Box, open Chrome browser and navigate to http://198.18.133.1/certsrv/ and login with ***username: `admin`*** and ***password: `C1sco12345`*** if prompted

2. From here, click on ***Download a CA Certificate***

   ![json](../../../ASSETS/LABS/AD/CERTS/Cert-CSR-10.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

3. Since we only have a single CA in our lab environment, the only one that should show up should be "Current[CA]".  

   1. Set the ***Encoding Method*** as Base 64 and 
   
   2. click ***Download CA certificate***

   ![json](../../../ASSETS/LABS/AD/CERTS/ISE-GUI-CSR-1b.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

   You may see a prompt from the browser to ***Keep*** or ***Discard*** this download, choose ***Keep***.  By default, the file will save to the Downloads folder as `certnew.cer`

## Installing the Root CA Certificate in ISE

***Complete the following tasks:***

1. Open a new Chrome browser tab and navigate to the ISE Admin Portal at https://198.18.133.27 (or use the bookmark) and login with ***username: `admin`*** and ***password: `C1sco12345`*** 

2. Using the hamburger menu in the top left:

   1. Select ***Administration*** 
   
   2. Then under ***System*** select ***Certificates***

   ![json](../../../ASSETS/LABS/AD/CERTS/ISE-GUI-CSR-2.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

3. In the menu on the left, choose ***Trusted Certificates*** and then ***Import***

   ![json](../../../ASSETS/LABS/AD/CERTS/ISE-GUI-CSR-3.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

4. While in the `Import a new Certificate into the Certificate Store` screen, perform the following:
   
   1. Using the ***Choose File*** button, navigate to the Downloads folder and select the file we exported in the previous section above

   2. For `Friendly Name`, you can enter what you wish, but for the purposes of this lab module (and the screenshots below), we will be entering `DCLOUD LAB CA CERTIFICATE`

   3. Check the boxes as detailed below:

         ![json](../../../ASSETS/LABS/AD/CERTS/ISE-GUI-CSR-4.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
   
   4. Click the ***Submit*** button.  After the certificate uploads, you will be taken back to the ***Trusted Certificates*** screen

   5. Scroll through the list to locate and validate that your certificate file uploaded.  Here we see that ours was successfull:

         ![json](../../../ASSETS/LABS/AD/CERTS/ISE-GUI-CSR-5.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

Now that our Root CA Certificate is part of the Trusted Certificates store, lets generate a Certificate Signing Request.

## Generating a Certificate Signing Request

***Complete the following tasks:***

1. Assuming you are still logged into ISE and within the ***Administration > System > Certificates*** section from the last task, 

   1. On the left hand side choose ***Certificate Signing Requests*** and then 
   
   2. ***Generate Certificate Signing REquests (CSR)***

      ![json](../../../ASSETS/LABS/AD/CERTS/ISE-GUI-CSR-6.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

2. Fill out the Certificate Signing Request as follows:

   ```
   Usage = Multi-Use
   Allow Wildcard Certificates = leave unchecked
   Nodes = since this is a single-node deployment in our lab, select the only node available
   Subject:
      Common Name = leave at $FQDN$
      Organizational Unit = DCLOUD
      Organization = CISCO
      City = SJC
      State = CA
      Country = US
      Subject Alternative Name (SAN) - PLEASE SEE NOTE BELOW
      Key Type = RSA
      Key Length = 4096
      Digest to Sign With = SHA-512
   ```

      >[!NOTE]
      >While this form has the common name as `$FQDN$`, we also want to include the Fully Qualified Domain Name as a Subject Alternative Name as well, so the SAN fields should be filled out as follows:

   ```
   First Field Drop Down = select DNS and in the text field enter "ise.dcloud.cisco.com"
   Second Field Drop Down = select IP Address and in the text field enter 198.18.133.27
   ```
   Completed form should look like below:

      ![json](../../../ASSETS/LABS/AD/CERTS/ISE-GUI-CSR-9.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

3.  At the bottom right, click ***Generate***

4.  At this screen choose ***Export***.  This will save an `iseMultiUse.pem` file to the Downloads folder on the Windows Jump Host

      ![json](../../../ASSETS/LABS/AD/CERTS/ISE-GUI-CSR-8.png?raw=true "Import JSON")




## Signing the ISE CSR with Certificate Authority

***Complete the following tasks:***

1. From the same Windows Jump Host as the previous tasks, navigate to the "Downloads" folder, right click on the .pem file that was just downloaded from ISE, and choose "Edit with Notepad++"

   ![json](../../../ASSETS/LABS/AD/CERTS/ISE-GUI-CSR-10.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

>[!NOTE]
>If prompted to download update packages for Notepad++, just click "No"

2. Copy the entire contents of the Notepad++ file 


3. Open a new Chrome browser tab and enter the URL `http://198.18.133.1/certsrv` and log in with the credentials **username: `admin`** and **password: `C1sco12345`**

   ![json](../../../ASSETS/LABS/AD/CERTS/Cert-CSR-9.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

4. Within the Certificate Authority Web Site navigate the following:

   1. Click Request a Certificate

      ![json](../../../ASSETS/LABS/AD/CERTS/Cert-CSR-10b.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

   2. Click advanced certificate request

      ![json](../../../ASSETS/LABS/AD/CERTS/Cert-CSR-11.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

   3. To submit the Certificate Request paste the CSR as shown

      ![json](../../../ASSETS/LABS/AD/CERTS/Cert-CSR-12.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

   4. **Important** Select `Cisco Server Template` for the Certificate Template and click submit

      ![json](../../../ASSETS/LABS/AD/CERTS/Cert-CSR-13.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

   5. **Important** This time we'll actually select **Base 64 encoded** and then download the certificate

      ![json](../../../ASSETS/LABS/AD/CERTS/ISE-GUI-CSR-11.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

5. The certificate file should now be downloaded to the Downloads folder, by default it will be named `certnet.csr`

### Binding the CSR with the Certificate

***Complete the following tasks:***

1. Open a Chrome browser tab back to ISE (if you don't have one open already) by navigating to https://198.18.133.27 (or using the bookmark) and login with ***username: `admin`*** and ***password: `C1sco12345`*** 

2. Using the hamburger menu in the top left:

   1. Navigate to ***Administration*** 
   
   2. Under ***System*** select ***Certificates***

   ![json](../../../ASSETS/LABS/AD/CERTS/ISE-GUI-CSR-2.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

3. On the left choose:

   1. **Certificate Signing Requests** - then 
   
   2. Place a check next to the existing CSR (should only be one option) - then
   
   3. Choose **Bind Certificate**

   ![json](../../../ASSETS/LABS/AD/CERTS/ISE-GUI-CSR-12.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

4. For the next step:

   1. Select **Choose File** and navigate to/select the `certnet.csr` file we exported earlier.

   2. Choose a **Friendly Name** - for the purposes of this lab module we will use `DCLOUD ISE CERTIFICATE`

   3. Put checks next to **Admin, EAP Authentication, RADIUS DTLS, and pxGrid**.  Note that you may receive popups like the below when you check each of these.  Choose **OK** for each.

   4. Your screen should look like below, choose **Submit**

   ![json](../../../ASSETS/LABS/AD/CERTS/ISE-GUI-CSR-13.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

6. You will get a couple of [!Warning] messages.  Oneabout Enabling Admin role, and another about certificate validity being longer than 398 days.  Choose **YES** to both of these.  At this point the ISE application will reboot.  Wait approximately 5 minutes and log back into ISE.

Congrats, your ISE instance is now ...CERTIFIED!
