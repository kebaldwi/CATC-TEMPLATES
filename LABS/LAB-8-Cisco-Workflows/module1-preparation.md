# Preparation - Getting Started Guide

## Module Overview

You must have a Meraki Account that has full Organizational Administrator permissions for an Organization that is hosted in NORTH AMERICA to be able to complete this lab. 

If you already have an account with full Organizational Administrator permissions on an account in North America, you will only need to complete [step 3](#step-3---enable-automate-workflows) and Enable Automate Workflows.

If you do not, complete all of the following steps.

### Step 1 - Create a Meraki Organization

If you do not have a Meraki account with these permissions hosted in North America, you can create one here: [account.meraki.com](https://account.meraki.com/login/new_account)

> [!NOTE]
> You MUST select North America as your region!

If you already have a Meraki account, you can use that. If you are a Cisco Employee DO NOT USE Cisco SSO that only has access to the Cisco demo account.

Later, when you sign in, choose Sign in to personal account. Do
not select Sign in with Cisco SSO.

### Step 2 - Create a Meraki Network

If you have created a new Meraki Organization, you will need to create a placeholder network.

> [!NOTE]
> This step is not required if you already have a Meraki Organization with at least one network.

On the left hand menu, select Network and Create a network
Enter a Network name and click Create network. Note: This network will not be used in the lab.

### Step 3 - Enable Automate Workflows

Enable Automate Workflows
Once you are logged in to your new Meraki account, select Organization -> Early Access
In the Early Access window, enable AI Assistant and Automate Workflows.
