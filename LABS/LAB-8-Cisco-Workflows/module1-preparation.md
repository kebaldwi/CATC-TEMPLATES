# Preparation - Getting Started Guide

## Module Overview

You must have a Meraki Account that has full Organizational Administrator permissions for an Organization that is hosted in NORTH AMERICA to be able to complete this lab. 

If you already have an account with full Organizational Administrator permissions on an account in North America, you will only need to complete [Step 3](#step-3---enable-automate-workflows) and Enable Automate Workflows.

If you do not, complete all of the following steps.

### Step 1 - Create a Meraki Organization

1. If you do not have a Meraki account with these permissions hosted in North America,  create one here: [account.meraki.com](https://account.meraki.com/login/new_account)

<div style="padding-left:40px;">
<table>
<tr>

> [!NOTE]
> You MUST select North America as your region!

</tr>
</table>
</div>

2. If you already have a Meraki account, you can use that. If you are a Cisco Employee **DO NOT USE** the Cisco SSO as that only has access to the Cisco demo account.

> [!NOTE]
> This step is not required if you already have a Meraki Organization with at least one network.

1. On the left hand menu, select Network and Create a network
