# Orientation

## Overview

Meraki has added a well-established Cisco tool to the dashboard; Workflows. But let’s be very clear, it’s not just for Meraki. Customers can use this powerful automation and orchestration engine on pretty much anything. In addition to Meraki, it can be used for automating Cisco controllers like Catalyst Center, SD-WAN, ISE, ThousandEyes, ACI, Nexus Dashboard, Intersight, Webex, IOT, and anything Cisco or 3rd party that utilizes REST-API. If it has a REST API or an SSH adapter, Workflows can automate it.

Today, we’re going to walk you through the tool. No programming experience required. If you can use Microsoft Visio, you can use Workflows. We are going to start with the absolute basics and build layer upon layer until we get into some more complex concepts in the tooling.

This Lab is designed as a set of standalone labs modules to help customers with varying challenges in Automating and Orchestrating their wired network infrastructure. Within the lab we will become oriented and accustomed to Cisco Workflows, its features and capabilities.

## General Information

Workflows has been the resultant of many years of evolution. Originally there was an acquisition from **Clickr** of a product which was used in the service provider space called **Action Orchestrator**. This tool was utilized to give a low to no code method of interacting with various systems and was incorporated in a platform called **MSX**. **MSX** was deprecated in 2022 and some of the code was used in **Secure X** which became **XDR** within the security suite. 

It was determined that a cloud orchestration platform was still needed for cross domain automation a few years ago and thus **Workflows** came into existence. Initially, in intersight, but then it was quickly realized that it needed to be within one platform covering the enterprise network. 

**Cisco Workflows** was then attached to the dashboard which is the defacto cloud automation tool for the Enterprise Network.




## Summary

Lets begin our journey creating our first couple of workflows to get a general understanding of the Cisco Workflows capabilities.
