# [Practical Template Examples](https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES/blob/master/TUTORIALS/ExamplesAndConcepts.md)

In this section I have compiled a number of template examples built with Jinja2 Language. These samples include a wide ranging set of configurations which may be used in your labs to solve specific configuration requirements. This collection summarizes aspects covered previously in this templating repository, and are aimed at providing quick practical references to help engineers solve automation tasks with the help of Cisco Catalyst Center. Additionally these examples may be used in testing in [dCloud](https://dcloud.cisco.com) with any of the labs on this repository.

> **Note:** Thank you for continuing your **support** of the **DNAC-Template Repository** by your continued visits to the site. Over the past few years we have developed a lot of content as a result, it is **time to reorganize** it to help be more consise, and to aide users in finding the relevant content easily. Over the next few months you will **notice changes and updates** to the repository, as we **add** additional content, **revise** existing dated content and nomenclature. The **folder structure** and **resources** will be **reorganized** for ease of use, and so that CODE examples and TUTORIALS will be grouped together for ease of use. We hope this will help users to find the content they need in an easier manner.

## [DNAC Templates Store](https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-Templates-Store)

This repository is built out to share Cisco Catalyst Center Templates and allow for ongoing submissions from those inclined to share their work with the community. Initially the repository includes all the examples that we have used in this repository in RAW TEXT and JSON format. After your first submission you will be able to continually add your templates as you develop new and interesting approaches to device management. 

Please maintain the directory structure with submissions. If you have a suggestion please reach out and contact me.

Please use this menu to navigate the various sections of this separate [DNAC Templates Store](https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-Templates-Store) Github repository. Within the multiple folders are examples, explanation readme files for reference.

* [DAY ZERO JSON](https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-Templates-Store/tree/main/DAY-ZERO-JSON) - JSON files for easy import to Cisco Catalyst Center for Day Zero
* [DAY N JSON](https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-Templates-Store/tree/main/DAY-N-JSON) - JSON files for easy import to Cisco Catalyst Center for Day N
* [REGULAR JSON](https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-Templates-Store/tree/main/DAY-N-JSON/REGULAR-JSON) - JSON files for easy import to Cisco Catalyst Center for Day N
* [COMPOSITE JSON](https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-Templates-Store/tree/main/DAY-N-JSON/COMPOSITE-JSON) - JSON files for easy import to Cisco Catalyst Center for Day N

## Examples

These examples must be used with two conditions:

* Deployed a PnP Discovery method and DHCP scope - see [PnP Workflow](https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES/tree/master/TUTORIALS/PnP-Workflow.md#pnp-workflow)
* Build the template with methods detailed - see [Creating Templates](https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES/tree/master/TUTORIALS/Templates.md#template-creation)

When building the template you will need to select a scripting language. Specific examples of Templates in the two scripting languages supported are available in the following folders:

* [Velocity Template Examples](https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES/tree/master/CODE/TEMPLATES/VELOCITY/)
* [Jinja2 Template Examples](https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES/tree/master/CODE/TEMPLATES/JINJA2) 

The conditions that they are used are documented and are explained in [Onboarding Templates](https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES/tree/master/TUTORIALS/Onboarding.md) and examples of DayN Templates are explained in [DayN Templates](https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES/tree/master/TUTORIALS/DayN.md)
