# Onboarding Templates and Flows [![published](https://static.production.devnetcloud.com/codeexchange/assets/images/devnet-published.svg)](https://developer.cisco.com/codeexchange/github/repo/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES)

In this section will go through the flow involved in creating a Template from an IOS configuration script for a Catalyst switch and various thoughts around how to link it to a Switch profile and deploy it through Cisco Catalyst Center using Plug and Play workflows.

Cisco Catalyst Center can be used for not only Plug and Play but also Day N or Ongoing Templates. Typically customers will start by building out an Onboarding Template which might deploy only enough information to bring the device up initially or it might include the entire configuration typical for a traditional networking device.

Of note is that Onboarding templates are deployed one time only when the device is being brought online. While there is nothing wrong in doing only this, its important to understand that there is a lot more power gained by being able to modify templates and redeploy them or parts of them for ongoing changes and modifications. For ongoing modifications Day N templates should be considered for those parts of device configuration that undergo routine changes. Additionally, keeping your onboarding configuration lightweight means that you gain the maximum flexibility of being able to make ongoing changes later.

Another important consideration is that part of a typical configuration would include some lines of code which will be built out with the *Design >Network Settings >* application within Cisco Catalyst Center. If the Design component of Cisco Catalyst Center is used you should not deploy additional CLI code to the device from that point on to avoid conflicting statements between Design component generated code and manual CLI supplied via a template. Its a decision you have to make upfront and avoids a lot of lines in the templates. 

As a guidance try and use Design settings for as much of the configurations as you can, leaving Templates light and nimble for ongoing changes.

## Cisco Catalyst Center Design Preparation

Before Cisco Catalyst Center can automate the deployment we have to complete a few tasks in preparation:

1. The **Hierarchy** within Cisco Catalyst Center. This will be used to roll out code and configurations continuously, so my guidance around this is to closely align this to the change management process. If you need change management scoped to floors or even Intermediate/Main Distribution Facilities then its a good idea to build your hierarchy to suit this. There are plenty of blogs and guides about how to do this. Good place to start is [Design the Network Hierarchy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/cloud-systems-management/network-automation-and-management/dna-center/2-3-3/user_guide/b_cisco_dna_center_ug_2_3_3/m_design-the-network-hierarchy.html). **(required)**
2. **Network Settings** can then be added hierarchically - either inherited and/or overidden at each subordinate level throughout the site hierarchy. The following is a description of the Network Settings and configurations that can be applied **(optional)**:
   1. **AAA Servers** - *both Network Administration and Client/Endpoint Authentication*
   2. **DHCP Servers** - *DHCP Server Addresses for Vlan Interfaces for example*
   3. **DNS Servers** - *both the Domain Suffix and the DNS servers used for lookups*
   4. **SYSLOG Servers** - *the servers to which logging will be sent*
   5. **SNMP Servers** - *the servers to which SNMP traps will be sent and or that will poll the device*
   6. **Netflow Collector Servers** - *the server to which Netflow is sent*
   7. **NTP Servers** - *NTP Server Addresses*
   8. **Timezone** - *Timezone to be used in logging*
   9. **Message of Day** - *Banner displayed when you log into a device*

      ![json](../ASSETS/DesignSettings.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

3. **Device Credentials** can then be added hierarchically being either inherited and or overidden at each subordinate level throughout the site hierarchy. The following is a description of the credentials and configurations that can be applied **(required)**:
   1. **CLI Credentials** - *Usernames, Passwords and Enable Passwords*
   2. **SNMP Credentials** - *SNMP v1, v2 for both Read and Write as well as SNMP v3*
   3. **HTTP(S) Credentials** - *HTTP(S) usernames and passwords for both Read and Write Access*
4. **Image Repository** should be populated with the image of the network device you wish to deploy. You can import the image using the **+Import** link which will open a popup allowing you to choose a file from the local file system, or allow you to reference a URL for either HTTP or FTP transfer. You then indicate whether the file is Cisco or 3rd Party image and click import. Once the file is imported, you can go into the imported images section and assign it to a specific type of device. Select the image and mark it as golden for PnP to use it. **(required)**

## Onboarding Templates

Onboarding templates are regular templates which serve the purpose of onboarding the device as mentioned with the minimal amount of code necessary to get connectivity up to the device in a consistent manner and to allow for further configuration via DayN templates, and device provisioning. Typically, there are two types of configurations that are used here: Layer3 routed, or Layer2 access. Both have different use cases, and while they are typical, they are by no means the only types of configuration used in this context. Onbaording Templates make use of [**Regular Templates**](#regular-templates) which make use of a specific scripting language.

### Regular Templates 

The use of regular templates allows you to reuse build code in the form of a set of IOS commands listed out very much like a configuration file. Those commands may be nested within logical constructs using either Velocity or Jinja2 scripting language, but the intent is that this regular template is a set of instructions initiated on a target device to create a configuration. Here we may introduce Variables, Conditional Logic and Looping constructs to address the delivery of conficguration. 

#### **Jinja2 Scripting Language** 

Cisco Catalyst Center allows for the use of Jinja2 Scripting Language which bares some resembelance to Python. It uses similar Variable, Conditional Logic and Looping constructs as Python and allows for developers who use Python to make an easy quick transition to utilizing this form of scripting language. Additionally, Jinja2 incorporates **include** and **extend** functionality which Velocity 1.7.5 does not have implemented within Cisco Catalyst Center. This allows for better modularization and reuse of code, in addition to the Composite Template approach.

**Examples:**

   - [Onboarding Template Examples](../CODE/TEMPLATES/JINJA2/ONBOARDING/)

#### **Velocity Scripting Language**

Cisco Catalyst Center allows for the use of Velocity Scripting Language which was previously used in Prime Infrastruture. It uses typical Variable, Conditional Logic and Looping constructs and allows for not only developers but also network engineers who may not have experience with programming languages to make an easy quick transition to utilizing this form of scripting language. Modularization and reuse of code, can be supported with the use of Composite Templates.

**Examples:**

   - [Onboarding Template Examples](../CODE/TEMPLATES/VELOCITY/ONBOARDING/)

### Example Template

To that end, a set of examples has been provided in the [**Jinja2**](#jinja2-scripting-language) and [**Velocity**](#velocity-scripting-language) folders above. One of those examples is the one I most typically see used with customer deployments. Included there is a [⬇︎Full Cisco Catalyst Center PnP Onboarding Template⬇︎](https://git-link.vercel.app/api/download?url=https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES/blob/master/CODE/TEMPLATES/JINJA2/ONBOARDING/DNAC-SAMPLE-TEMPLATES-01302023-PnP-template.json) for import into Cisco Catalyst Center.

Both of these Templates have the settings necessary to bring up a Layer2 access switch with enough configration to be supported by Cisco Catalyst Center for the rest of the provisioning process.

## Onboarding Template Deployment

Once you have built your onboarding template you then have to let **Cisco Catalyst Center** know where you want it to apply it. We will assume at this point you have already created/imported the above template. You would then follow the following steps:
   1. Create network profile Under *Design> Network Profiles* you will select **+Add Profile**

      ![json](../ASSETS/NetworkProfile.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

   2. Select the type of device (ie Switching)
   3. Profile name

      ![json](../ASSETS/NetworkProfileTabs.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

   4. On the Onboarding Template page select device type **(required)**

      ![json](../ASSETS/OnboardingDevice.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

   5. On the Onboarding Template page select the template(s) to be used for onboarding **(required)**

      ![json](../ASSETS/OnboardingTemplate.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

   6. On the DayN Template page select device type **(optional)** (for more info [DayN Templates](./DayN.md))

      ![json](../ASSETS/DayNtemplates.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

   7. On the DayN Template page select the template(s) to be used for Day N provisioning **(optional)** (for more info [DayN Templates](./DayN.md))
   8. Save the network profile
   9. Assign the network profile to the site hierarchy element

If the Network Profile is already deployed it can be edited at a later date to add Onboarding templates by following these steps:
   1. Click edit next to the network profile Under *Design> Network Profiles*  
   2. On the Onboarding Template page select device type **(required)**

      ![json](../ASSETS/DayNtemplates.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

   3. On the Onboarding Template page select the template(s) to be used for onboarding **(required)**
   4. Save the network profile
   5. Assign the network profile to the hierarchy

> [!CAUTION] 
> If you populate the Cisco Catalyst Center Design section, those parameters should **not** be in your templates CLI payload as they will conflict and device provisioning will fail. While it is easy to populate these settings it is best to test with a switch to see what resultant CLI configuration statements are pushed.

## Claiming and Provisioning

At this point Cisco Catalyst Center is set up and ready for Plug and Play to onboard the first device. Provided Cisco Catalyst Center discovery methods are properly configured (ie DHCP-based, or DNS record-based), the out-of-box device during boot up process discover Cisco Catalyst Center, and register itself in the plug n play section of the provisioning page.

At this point you can claim the device putting it in a planned state for onboarding onto the system. To do this do the following:

   1. Put a checkmark next to the device to be claimed
   2. Click the Claim link and walk through the workflow
   3. Section 1 select the part of the hierarchy to which the device will be deployed then click next
   4. Section 2 you can click the device hyperlink and view or amend the template and image utilized then click next
   5. Section 3 you can manipulate any of the variables within the template if used then click next
   6. Section 4 review the elements including configuration to be deployed 
   7. Click claim to initiate
   
At this stage the device will be placed in **Planned** state, and will cycle through **Onboarding** and **Provisioned** when complete. After the device is completed it will appear in the device inventory after being sync'd with Cisco Catalyst Center.

![json](../ASSETS/pnp-registered.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

## Automating Claiming and Provisioning

While it is possible to click through the claiming and process, for bulk deployments its important to be able to automate this process as well. With Cisco Catalyst Center after the templates are built and assigned to the network profile and assigned to a site, they may be referenced and used by uploading a csv file to Cisco Catalyst Center via REST API.

This methodology allows for you to specify variables within the csv, serial numbers, and put devices into a planned state waiting for them to land on the Plug and Play page on Cisco Catalyst Center.
