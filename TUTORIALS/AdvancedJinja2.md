# Advanced Jinja2 [![published](https://static.production.devnetcloud.com/codeexchange/assets/images/devnet-published.svg)](https://developer.cisco.com/codeexchange/github/repo/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES)

This section will describe the various advanced templating techniques used to make a powerful script out of normal CLI command scripts which are used by organizations on IOS devices around the world. This section builds on the previous sections and is an attempt to demystify the hows and to bring clarity on what is truely possible. While it is possible to take a CLI script for one device and create a template for one device at a time, that would leave us with a lot of templates and make it harder to make changes on an ongoing basis. Using the techniques below will allow us to deploy equipment with scripts which can be reused, allowing us to keep configurations similar for conformity reasons but also to reduce the number of places where changes would have to be made. 

Below will be examples of various use cases that could be implemented.

### Parsing Integers from String Variables

In the following example a variable is bound to Cisco Catalyst Centers database and a value is called for the Native Vlan. As all data within the database is essentially in string format, if we wish to use it with some mathematics to calculate other values, we would first need to change it (ie cast) from a string to a integer.

In order to acomplish this we need to use this example. We will use the *int* modifier to parse the bind variable to an integer variable using set notation.

[//]: # ({% raw %})
```j2
   {% set native_vlan = native_vlan_bind | integer %}
   {% set data_vlan = native_vlan + 10 %}
```

### Working with Arrays or Ordered Lists

To create an array we have to perform the following. First, we need to concatenate the values into a variable with some kind of delimiter. Then using the delimiter we can split the values into separate elements within the array and call them separately through a loop.

```j2
   {% set StackPIDs = ProductID.split(",") %}
   !
   {% for Switch in StackPIDs %}
        {% set PortCount = Switch.replaceAll('^.*([2|4][4|8]).*','$1') %}
   {% endfor %}
```
Another way we may work with arrays is to use the append operator. We will add this to the previous block of code and the method would look like this. In order to use the Append method we need an empty array. Then we append into the array with each iteration placing only the *24* or *48* from the Product ID.

```j2
   {% set PortTotal = [] %}
   {% set StackPIDs = ProductID.split(",") %}
   !
   {% for Switch in StackPIDs %}
        {% set PortCount = Switch.replaceAll('^.*([2|4][4|8]).*','$1') %}
        {% do PortTotal.append(PortCount) %}
   {% endfor %}
```

We can utilize other methods like length but in the next addition we build out ports for the switch based on ranges. Take note of the use of the loop.index variable.

```j2
   {% set PortTotal = [] %}
   {% set StackPIDs = ProductID.split(",") %}
   !
   {% for Switch in StackPIDs %}
        {% set PortCount = Switch.replaceAll('^.*([2|4][4|8]).*','$1') %}
        {% do PortTotal.append(PortCount) %}
   {% endfor %}
   !
   {% for SwitchPort in PortTotal %}
       interface {{ loop.index }}/0/1 - {{ SwitchPort }}
         desc test
   {% endfor %}
```

### Working with Objects

It is also possible to create objects which can then be referenced through similar looping constructs. Below we create an object which contains Vlan ID's to build the Vlan Database on a target switch. This might be kept in a separate file regular template which may be included or extended to utilize it. 

```j2
{% set SiteAVlans = [
  {'vlan':'2','name':'MGMT'},
  {'vlan':'100','name':'Data'},
  {'vlan':'200','name':'Voice'},
  {'vlan':'300','name':'AccessPoints'},
  {'vlan':'400','name':'IOT'},
  {'vlan':'500','name':'PCI'}
  ]%}

{% set SiteBVlans = [
  {'vlan':'4','name':'MGMT'},
  {'vlan':'10','name':'Data'},
  {'vlan':'20','name':'Voice'},
  {'vlan':'30','name':'AccessPoints'},
  {'vlan':'40','name':'IOT'},
  {'vlan':'50','name':'PCI'}
  ]%}

```

We then build a loop stucture to deploy the Vlans and perhaps build that into a macro for deployment.


```j2
{% macro configure_vlans(vlanpairs)  %}
  {% for vlanpair in vlanpairs %}
    vlan {{ vlanpair['vlan'] }}
    name {{ vlanpair['name'] }}
  {% endfor %}
{% endmacro %}
```

Then perhaps build a logical structure to account for differing Site Objects.

```j2
{% if Site == "SiteA" %}
  {{ configure_vlans(SiteAvlans) }}
{% elif Site == "SiteB" %}
  {{ configure_vlans(SiteBvlans) }}
{% endif %}
```

### Include and Extend with Jinja2

Within Jinja2 templates in Cisco Catalyst Center its possible to both Include and Extend regular templates. Lets discuss first what these are and how they differ from each other, and then how they may be leveraged.

#### Include

Include statements may be used in Jinja2 to augment regular templates. They are used to allow an entire regular template file to be inserted at the point of the include statement. The include statement shown here is an example, but you can see the parent project and then the regular template name are referenced as you would a file system:

```j2
{% include "Some-Project/VlanDatabases" %}
```

This allows you to maintain code within separate templates for development purposes and to reuse code without the need for a composite template.

#### Extend

Extend statements are used in Jinja2 similarly to augment regular templates, but they differ in a number of ways. First the code to be extended is contained in block within the regular template. Here is an theoretical example:

```j2
{% block SiteAVlans %}
!
{#- Vlans per Site Type -#}
{% set SiteAVlans = [
  {'vlan':'2','name':'MGMT'},
  {'vlan':'100','name':'Data'},
  {'vlan':'200','name':'Voice'},
  {'vlan':'300','name':'AccessPoints'},
  {'vlan':'400','name':'IOT'},
  {'vlan':'500','name':'PCI'}
  ]%}
{% endblock %}

{% block SiteBVlans %}
!
{#- Vlans per Site Type -#}
{% set SiteBVlans = [
  {'vlan':'4','name':'MGMT'},
  {'vlan':'10','name':'Data'},
  {'vlan':'20','name':'Voice'},
  {'vlan':'30','name':'AccessPoints'},
  {'vlan':'40','name':'IOT'},
  {'vlan':'50','name':'PCI'}
  ]%}
!
{% endblock %}

```

This regular template may then be extended by using a statement shown here is an example. This line is put in the extended template. You can see the parent project and then the regular template name are referenced as you would a file system: 

```j2
{% extends "Some-Project/GlobalServices" %}
```

The extended regular template is then referenced within the source template ('GlobalServices' in the example above) with this code block

```j2
{% block SiteAVlans %}
{% endblock %}
```

This allows you to put logical structures around this code augmenting when it is used and when it is not. For example:

```j2
{% if Site == "SiteA" %}
  {% block SiteAVlans %}
  {% endblock %}
{% elif Site == "SiteB" %}
  {% block SiteBVlans %}
  {% endblock %}
{% endif %}   
```

Now only the code required is used when rendering the template.

### Working with Stacks of 9300/9200 and Powerstacking

One area we need to address is how to effectively deal with stacking 9300's and how to deal with a stack of 8 switches where a powerstack only allows 4. Although not supported by TAC this is supported from a platform point of view. Essentially you would build the data stack of 8 switches, and then build two powerstacks of four switches in each. In the following example I share is based on velocity code which was co-written by Josh Bronikowski. 

In order to acomplish this we need to first identify how many switches are in the stack... please use this example. 

```j2
   {% set StackCount = __device.platformId | split(",")  %}
   {% set StackMemberCount =  StackCount | length  -%}
```
Then we need a logical construct which iterates through each switch, setting not only the priority correctly but also setting the powerstack correctly.

```j2
   {% if StackMemberCount > 1 %}
     {% if "C93" in __device.platformId %}
        stack-power stack Powerstack1
        mode redundant strict
        {% if StackMemberCount > 4 %}
           stack-power stack Powerstack2
           mode redundant strict
        {% endif %}
        {% for Switch in range(0,StackMemberCount,1) %}
           stack-power switch {{ loop.index }}
           {% if loop.index <= (StackMemberCount/2|round('ceil')) or StackMemberCount < 5 %}
              stack Powerstack1
           {% elif loop.index > (StackMemberCount/2|round('ceil')) %}
              stack Powerstack2
           {% endif %}
        {% endfor %}
     {% endif %}
     #MODE_ENABLE
     {% for Switch in range(0,StackMemberCount,1) %}
       {% if loop.index == 1 %}
          switch {{ loop.index }} priority 10
       {% elif loop.index == 2 %}
          switch {{ loop.index }} priority 9
       {% else %}
          switch {{ loop.index }} priority 8
       {% endif %}
     {% endfor %}
     #MODE_END_ENABLE
   {% endif %}
```
Explained here...
1. The code shared will run only if the number of switches in the stack is found to be greater than 1. This means that stackpower is only configured on stacks of two or more switches. 

```j2
   {% if StackMemberCount > 1 %}
```

2. The next step is to correctly set the number of powerstack required. If the number of switches exceeds 4 then we need two powerstacks set up.

```j2
   stack-power stack Powerstack1
   mode redundant strict
   {% if StackMemberCount > 4 %}
      stack-power stack Powerstack2
      mode redundant strict
   {% endif %}
```

3. The next step is to iterate through the switches in the stack setting the stackpower appropriately for each switch and adding them to the correct powerstack 

```j2
   {% for Switch in range(0,StackMemberCount,1) %}
      {% if loop.index <= (StackMemberCount/2|round('ceil')) %}
         stack-power switch {{ loop.index }}
         stack Powerstack1
      {% elif loop.index > (StackMemberCount/2|round('ceil')) %}
         stack-power switch {{ loop.index }}
         stack Powerstack2
      {% endif %}
      {{ loop.index }}
   {% endfor %}
```
4. Lastly, we will set the switch priority appropriately on each switch for master and standby, and then for the remaining switches within the stack so that switch numbering matches the priority levels.

```j2
   {% for Switch in range(0,StackMemberCount,1) %}
      {% if loop.index == 1 %}
         switch {{ loop.index }} priority 10
      {% elif Switch == 2 %}
         switch {{ loop.index }} priority 9
      {% else %}
         switch {{ loop.index }} priority 8
      {% endif %}
   {% endfor %}
```


### Working with port counts within Catalyst 9k

One area we need to address is how to effectively deal configuring multiple ports. For this we will make use of multiple concepts as we build out this use case.

First we would need to identify how many ports we have on each switch or linecard, and how many linecards or switches within the stack or chassis there are. For this example we are using a stack of 9300's, but you can build this for 9400's.

We set up variables to track in Array format the number of ports per switch.

```j2
   {% set PortTotal = [] %}
   {% set StackPIDs = ProductID.split(",") %}
   {% for Switch in StackPIDs %}
        {% set PortCount = Switch.replaceAll('^.*([2|4][4|8]).*','$1') %}
        {% do PortTotal.append(PortCount) %}
   {% endfor %}
```

The next step would be to build macros and vlans to configure the various ports.

```j2
   vlan {{data_vlan_number}}
     name {{site_code}}-Employees
   vlan {{voice_vlan_number}}
     name {{site_code}}-Voice
   vlan {{iot_vlan_number}}
     name {{site_code}}-IOT
   vlan {{guest_vlan_number}}
     name {{site_code}}-Guests
   vlan {{ap_vlan_number}}
     name {{site_code}}-AP
   
   {% macro uplink_interface() %}
       switchport trunk allowed vlan add {{voice_vlan_number}},{{iot_vlan_number}},{{guest_vlan_number}},{{ap_vlan_number}}     
   {% endmacro %}
   
   {% macro access_interface () %}
      description base port config
      switchport mode access
      switchport access vlan {{data_vlan_number}}
      switchport voice vlan {{voice_vlan_number}}
      spanning-tree portfast
      spanning-tree bpduguard enable
   {% endmacro %}
   
   {% for SwitchPort in PortTotal %}
        interface range gi {{ loop.index }}/0/1 - {{ SwitchPort }}
          {{ access_interface() }}
   {% endfor %}
   
   interface portchannel 1
    {{ uplink_interface() }}
```
[//]: # ({% endraw %})

While this would configure the access ports, and modify the port channel for upstream connectivity we could do more to automate we will look at that next.
