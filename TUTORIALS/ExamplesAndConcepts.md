# Practical Template Examples [![published](https://static.production.devnetcloud.com/codeexchange/assets/images/devnet-published.svg)](https://developer.cisco.com/codeexchange/github/repo/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES)

When working with many customers over the past 6 years with automation, I have seen the same questions asked in workshop after workshop. Are there practical examples of templates that we can use as a starting point to begin deploying with automation.

After working with well over 30 customers, I have come up with templates which fit for the majority of typical access switch situations. 

Within this section we will only deal with the non Fabric environment and deployment.

## Intent Based Networking

Either one or multiple Templates may be used to deploy Intent in combination with the Design Settings and Policies deployed within the UI. One or Multiple templates may be used in Onboarding (PnP) or Day N methods. Day N methods are designed for making ongoing changes and may require 'no' statements depending on the configuration construct being modified. 

Additionally:
1.	Intent can be defined as the set of configuration constructs deployed via a template.
2.	Variables can be used to modify or choose between constructs deployed via decision (‘IF’) statements
3.	Repetition of any construct may be introduced through the use of Looping structures on any device.
4.	Variables may be used when the device is being onboarded or provisioned

## Plug and Play (PnP) Template

### Why

To help get started with and better understand the PnP process we have provided this material. It is designed to help you understand the Plug and Play process, templates and deployment of these within a lab setting. Once you are comfortable with the concepts you can work on a deployment and implementation plan for your network.

### What

To help get started with the PnP process and to better understand the process, please review the following information:

### Features

This template includes a number of built in features, which allow for the majority of use cases. We will explore those here in this section.

<details closed>
<summary> Click for Details and Sub Tasks</summary>

Within the form you can see many fields which can be populated with a csv file. These are the typical responses necessary that are different from switch to switch which allow us to template the configuration for repeated use. 

1. The hostname.
2. System MTU is a default setting which if entered changes the configuration. You can have the switch reload to set that setting if you want using an additional EEM script.
3. The typical management VLAN and IP address information for management purposes.
4. The interfaces can be entered comma delimited which allows us to create or not create Etherchannels as necessary. 

![json](../ASSETS/TUTORIALS/EXAMPLES/DNAC-SAMPLE-TEMPLATE-PnP-Form.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

Once you have imported the template you can look at the logic.

#### Key Features
[//]: # ({% raw %})
1. System MTU set by default, but modifiable via the form
2. VTP Domain set to Hostname, you can change to variable by removing `{% set VtpDomain = Hostname %}`
3. Shuts downn Vlan 1 if not in use
4. Automatically builds Etherchannel if required

[⬇︎Full Catalyst Center Sample Project⬇︎](https://git-link.vercel.app/api/download?url=https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES/blob/master/CODE/TEMPLATES/JINJA2/DAYN/JSON/Titanium_WiredAutoLab_Jinja2_project.json)

### Features

This project includes templates with a number of built in features, which allow for the majority of use cases. We will explore those here in this section.

<details closed>
<summary> Click for Details and Sub Tasks</summary>

The package or project includes Jinja2 templates which are rolled into Composite templates to allow for quick deployment of:

1. Simple Access Point and Workstation Deployments.
2. The use or incorporation of AutoConf to Autoconfigure ports based off Device Classification
3. The use of IBNS 2.0 policy to enforce and deploy configuration.

The last of the two above, allow for Dynamic Configuration of networks to allow for networks where devices consistently move but where user and application experience needs to be consistent.

Once you have imported the template you can look at the logic within each modularized regular template. Each of these templates is part of the composites above, and some are referenced using includes where necessary to avoid repeating code.

#### Key Features

1. AAA Configuration for nonPxGrid - *Deployments*
2. ACLs 
3. Autoconf Configuration Options
4. AutoNaming EEM Scripting - *for Interfaces* 
5. DynamicPort EEM Scripting - *for use in changing Auth profiles*
6. IBNS2.0 Configuration
7. Interface Assign Configuration - *for standard interface configurations*
8. Interface Autoconf Configuration - *for dynamic configuration through device classification*
9. Interface IBNS2.0 Configuration - *for policy based interface configuration*
10. Interface Macros - *set of multi-purpose interface macros*
11. Security AAA Modifications - *various security configurations*
12. Sensitive Info - *for securing sensitive information from general configs*
13. Stacking Configuration - *for powerstack and stackwise configuration*
14. System Management - *for global configurations*
15. Vlans Info - *includes examples of how to deploy Vlans using objects*

I hope you find these samples highly useful, and please provide feedback.
