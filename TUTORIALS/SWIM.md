## Operation of Software Image Management (SWIM)

**Software Image Management (SWIM)** in the Cisco Catalyst Center provides a streamlined approach to managing software images across network devices. SWIM allows network administrators to automate the deployment, validation, and compliance of software images, ensuring that all devices run the correct versions of software for optimal performance and security.

### Golden Images

#### What are Golden Images?

**Golden images** are pre-configured software images that serve as the baseline for deploying software across multiple devices. These images are tested and verified to ensure they meet organizational standards and requirements. By using golden images, organizations can minimize inconsistencies and reduce the time required for software deployment.

#### TAG's Hierarchy and Roles

The **Hierarchy, Roles** and **TAG's** in Cisco Catalyst Center play a critical role in aligning the right golden images for deployment:

![Software Image Management](../ASSETS/SWIM-image-management.png?raw=true "Software Image Management")

- **Hierarchy**: This structure allows administrators to categorize devices based on their specific requirements and characteristics. Each part of the hierarchy can include different factors such as device type, and location, or function, enabling targeted deployments of golden images. In the image above you will notice hte Golden Image for the DEMO site. 
  
- **Roles**: By assigning roles to devices, administrators can ensure that only the appropriate golden images are deployed to specific groups. For example, a role assigned to access switches may require a different golden image than that of border routers.

- **TAG's** This structure allows administrators to categorize devices based on their use case specific requirements and characteristics. Each tag can represent different factors such as device type, feature, or function, enabling targeted deployments of golden images. These TAGs may mirror those used in Templates.

By leveraging TAG's Hierarchy and Roles, organizations can effectively manage which golden images are deployed to which devices, ensuring compliance and optimizing network performance.

#### Golden Images in Plug and Play (PnP)

In the context of **Plug and Play (PnP)**, golden images are utilized to simplify the onboarding process of new devices. When a new device is connected to the network, it can automatically retrieve its designated golden image based on its TAG and Role. This automation reduces manual configuration efforts and accelerates device deployment, ensuring consistency across the network.

### Readiness, Pre and Post Checks

There are essentially three separate checks which can be completed when automating through Software Image Management. Seen in the image below they are the following: 

- **Image Readiness Check** which checks the target system readiness

  ![Software Image Management](../ASSETS/SWIM-ReadinessCheck.png?raw=true "Software Image Management")

- **Software Distribution** which carries out pre and post checks for distribution of the target system

  ![Software Image Management](../ASSETS/SWIM-Distribution-Checks.png?raw=true "Software Image Management")

- **Software Activation** which carries out pre and post checks for activation of the target system.

  ![Software Image Management](../ASSETS/SWIM-Activation-Checks.png?raw=true "Software Image Management")

- **Custom Checks** which allow additional checks of the target system.

### Image Deployment Options

There are essentially two separate actions automated through Software Image Management. Seen in the image below they are the following: 

- **Software Distribution** which is transfering the image to the target system
- **Software Activation** which is activating (using) the image on the target system.

### 1. Deploying and Activating the Image in the Same Workflow

In this method, the deployment and activation of the software image occur within a single workflow. This approach is efficient for scenarios where immediate activation is required. The steps typically include:

- **Select the Golden Image**: Choose the appropriate golden image based on TAGs and Roles. and assign to the devices via Hierarchy, Role and TAG.

During the Deployment of Software use Deploy and Activate the image after deployment. This includes:

- **Distribute the Image**: Push the image to the target devices.
- **Activate the Image**: Automatically activate the image once deployment is complete

This method is ideal for environments where downtime is minimal, and quick updates are necessary. During this type of upgrade both the **Distribution** and **Activation** would be completed in a **single workflow** as seen here.

![Software Image Management](../ASSETS/SWIM-Distribution-Activation.png?raw=true "Software Image Management")

### 2. Deploying (Staging) and Activating the Image in Separate Workflows

This approach involves two distinct workflows: one for staging the image and another for activation. The steps include:

- **Staging the Image**: Distribute the golden image to the target devices without activating it immediately. This allows for testing and validation.
- **Activating the Image**: Once the image has been verified, a separate workflow is initiated to activate the image on the devices.

This method provides greater control and flexibility, allowing administrators to ensure that the images are functioning correctly before activation. During this type of upgrade both the **Distribution** and **Activation** would be completed in a **separate workflows** as seen here. In the first workflow you can see we have **SKIPPED** **Activation** and thus the image is only **Distributed**.

![Software Image Management](../ASSETS/SWIM-Distribution-Skip-Activation.png?raw=true "Software Image Management")

In the second workflow you can see we complete the **Activation** of the image.

### Monitoring and Control via ServiceNow

**SWIM** can be effectively monitored and controlled through **ServiceNow**, an IT service management platform. Integration with ServiceNow allows organizations to:

- **Automate Incident Management**: Automatically create incidents in ServiceNow when issues related to software images are detected.
- **Change Management**: Manage and track changes to software images through ServiceNow, ensuring compliance with organizational policies.
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Utilize ServiceNow's reporting tools to gain insights into software image deployments, compliance status, and operational metrics.

By leveraging ServiceNow, organizations can enhance their operational efficiency and ensure that software image management aligns with broader IT service management practices.
