# Building Templates [![published](https://static.production.devnetcloud.com/codeexchange/assets/images/devnet-published.svg)](https://developer.cisco.com/codeexchange/github/repo/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES)

In this section we will explain how to build a configuration Template in Cisco Catalyst Center.

## Intent Based Networking

Either one or multiple Templates may be used to deploy Intent in combination with the Design Settings and Policies defined in Cisco Catalyst Center UI. One or Multiple templates may be used in Onboarding (PnP) or Day N methods. Day N methods are designed for making ongoing changes and may require 'no' statements depending on the configuration construct being modified. 

### Additionally:

1.	Intent can be defined as the set of configuration constructs deployed via a template.
2.	Variables can be used to modify or choose between constructs deployed via decision (‘IF’) statements
3.	Repetition of any construct may be introduced through the use of Looping structures on any device.
4.	Variables may be used when the device is being onboarded or provisioned

## Philosophies

There are a number of coding paradigms which various programmers use when building, maintaining and publishing programming code which are extremely useful when trying to integrate programmability for use in modern day infrastructure use cases. Lets deal with each concept in turn:

  - imperative in which the programmer defines explicit instructions for the machine describing its state transitions
      - procedural which groups instructions into logical collections (ie procedures) which can be referenced by a name elsewhere in code
      - object-oriented which groups instructions together with the part of the state they operate on
  - declarative in which the programmer merely declares properties of the desired outcome, but defines no explicit instructions on not how to achieve it
      - functional, in which the desired outcome is declared as the value of a series of function applications
      - logical, in which the desired outcome is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules
      - mathematical, in which the desired outcome is declared as the solution of an optimization problem
        
## Modular Programming

Modular programming is a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable self-contained modules, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality.

A module refers to high-level decomposition of the code of an entire program into pieces: 
- structured programming to the low-level code use of structured control flow
- object-oriented programming to the data use of objects, a kind of data structure.

This calls out two very key points: 

  1. **Functionality**
     Code segmented into small chunks to manage complexity 
  2. **Reusability**
     Modular code designed for reuse as parts of functions

## Parsing IOS Configurations

As you begin your builds of Templates it helps to analyze the various IOS configurations and group logical syntactic components where we see reusability. 

Remember the Cisco Catalyst Center **Network Profile** offers a couple of options: independent template attachments, or in the Day N role - a composite template. Either is available for use.

Once you have grouped configuration snippets into separate logical constructs you can then see what additional platforms you might apply them too, as this will steer you in the direction of whether multiple modules (snippets) are required or whether you will need a complete duplication of certain functions (ie, code re-use concept).

Once we have identified all of the various modules we will need to achieve the desired configuration outcome, we can then start to analyze which functions can be accomplished via Cisco Catalyst Center 'Design' App. As noted earlier, we should avoid overlap of CLI statements defined in Templates and CLI statements generated by 'Design' App automatically. Wherever we see the overlap, the Cisco Catalyst Center Design App should have those settings defined, and we would remove the matching CLI statements from Template modules.

## Templates

We have two templates offered in Cisco Catalyst Center. A **Regular Template** which is designed to stand alone for a specific function and a **Composite template** which will group standard templates and which can only be used in Day N Projects.

As we build out a Regular Template we can either put all the IOS commands making up the configuration within the single Template - making it more complex to maintain, or we can separate out the various sections into separate Templates and associate them as additional templates in either the Onboarding or Day N flows.

Once you have created a new Template and pasted the IOS configurations into the template editor you can then look for repeating values (or placeholders) within the CLI statements which can be replaced by variables. 

### Variables

Variables are used to allow a script to dynamically substitute those placeholders with values applicable to that specific deployment. A variable within a script allows us to replace the data on demand, thereby allowing the reuse of parts or entire templates. Variables may be defined in a couple of ways, but the type of data will always be defined as either numeric or string. A numeric value is that which is treated as number (ie can be added or subtracted, for example) whereas a string is a collection of characters.

Inspect your configuration to make optimal use of variables to allow code reuse. Please refer to [Variables](./Variables.md).

### Velocity vs Jinja2 scripting considerations

When creating configuration Templates in Cisco Catalyst Center, you are offered a choice between Velocity and Jinja2 as the underlying scripting language that you want to use within your Template. 

[Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) is defined a fast, expressive, extensible templating engine. Special placeholders in the template allow writing code similar to Python syntax. Then the template is passed data to render the final document.

[Velocity](https://velocity.apache.org) is a Java-based template engine. It permits anyone to use a simple yet powerful template language to reference objects defined in Java code.

Making a choice between the two would come down mostly to personal preference between Pythonic (Jinja2) and Java (Velocity) statements. 
Due to Python popularity, we are seeing more customers leveraging Jinja2 as the Template Scripting language but capabilities and outcomes that can be achieved with either of these two are equivalent.

### Scripting Languages

To further simplify your IOS configuration analyze your IOS template for repeat patterns (ie, 24 port switch as opposed to a 48 port interface CLIs), and then build logical constructs to allow for one template to address multiple platforms.

While it is possible to take a CLI script for each device flavour, and create individual templates for each device type at a time, that would leave us with a lot of templates and make it harder to make changes on an ongoing basis. 

Using the techniques of Velocity or Jinja2 Scripting will allow us to deploy equipment with scripts which can be reused on a broader basis, allowing us to keep configurations similar for conformity reasons but also to reduce the number of places where changes would have to be made. 

For additional information please see:

* [Velocity Scripting](./Velocity.md)
* [Jinja2 Scripting](./Jinja2.md)

Within these logical constructs you have many tools and these are an example but not all of them, please review each section as needed:

* [If Statements](./Velocity.md#if-statements)
* [Macros](./Velocity.md#macros)
* [Loops](./Velocity.md#foreach-loops)
* [Multiline commands](./Velocity.md#multi-line-commands)

#### Jinja2 Scripting Logic

## Template Creation

Cisco Catalyst Center provides regular and composite configuration templates. CLI templates let you choose the elements in the configurations. Cisco Catalyst Center provides variables that you can replace with actual values and logic statements.

  * Create a Regular Template
  * Create a Composite Template
  * Edit Templates

### Create a Regular Template

1. From the Cisco Catalyst Center home page, choose Tools > Template Editor. By default, the Onboarding Configuration project is available for creating PnP templates. You can create your own custom projects. Templates created in custom projects are categorized as day-N templates.

   ![json](../ASSETS/GoToTemplateEditor.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

2. In the tree pane, select the project under which you are creating templates, and click the gear icon > Add Templates. Alternately, click > Add Templates.

   > [!TIP] 
   > The template that you create for day 0 can also be applied for day N.

   ![json](../ASSETS/CreateTemplate.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

3. In the Add New Template window, click Regular Template.

   ![json](../ASSETS/AddNewTemplate.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

4. In the Name text box, enter a unique name for the template.
5. In the Project Name drop-down list, select the project. 
   - The drop-down list is enabled if you are navigating from the > Add Templates path. 
   - The drop-down list is disabled if you select a project and click the gear icon > Add Templates in the tree pane.

   ![json](../ASSETS/SelectTemplateProject.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

6. In the Description text box, enter a description for the template. **optional**
7. In the Tags text box, enter an intuitive name to tag the templates. **optional** 
   Tagging a configuration template helps you to:
   - Search a template using the tag name in the search field.
   - Use the tagged template as a reference to configure more devices.

     > [!TIP] 
     > If you use tags to filter the templates, you must apply the same tags to the device to which you want to apply the templates. Otherwise, you get the following error during provisioning: Cannot select the device. Not compatible with template.

8. Click Edit to view the selected device types and choose the device types that you want to apply to the template.
   - To view the selected devices, choose Selected from the Show drop-down list. By default, all device types are displayed.
   - There are different granularity levels for choosing the device type from the hierarchical structure. The device type is used during deployment to ensure that templates deploy devices that match the specified device type criteria. This lets you create specialized templates for specific device models.

      > [!TIP] 
      > Template Editor does not show device product IDs (PIDs); instead, it shows the device series and model description. You can use cisco.com to look up the device data sheet based on the PID, find the device series and model description, and choose the device type appropriately.

   ![json](../ASSETS/SelectDeviceTemplate.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

9. After choosing the device types, click Back to Add New Template.
10. From the Software Type drop-down list, choose the software type: IOS, IOS-XE, IOS-XR, NX-OS, Cisco Controller, Wide Area Application Services, Adaptive Security Appliance, NFV- OS, and Others.
    - For more information on the Cisco Wireless Controller supported software versions and the minimum supported version, see Cisco Catalyst Center Supported Devices document.
    - For example, if you select IOS as the software type, the commands apply to all software types, including IOS-XE and IOS-XR. This value is used during provisioning to check whether the selected device conforms to the selection in the template.

   ![json](../ASSETS/SelectOSTemplate.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

11. In the Software Version text box, enter the software version. During provisioning, Cisco Catalyst Center checks to see if the selected device has the software version listed in the template. If there is a mismatch, the provision skips the template. **optional**
12. Click Add. The template is created and shown in the tree view under the project you selected.

   ![json](../ASSETS/AddTemplate.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

13. You can edit the template content by selecting the template that you created in the left menu. To edit the template content, see Edit Templates.
14. In the Template Editor window, enter content for the template. You can use the Velocity Template Language (VTL) to write the content in the template.

   ![json](../ASSETS/EditTemplateWindow.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

15. To save the template content, from the Actions drop-down list, choose Save.
16. To commit the template, from the Actions drop-down list, choose Commit. You can see only the committed templates in the network profile section.

    > [!TIP] 
    >You can associate only a committed template to a network profile.
