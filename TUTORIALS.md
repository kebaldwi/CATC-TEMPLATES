> Thank you for continuing your **support** of the **DNAC-Template Repository** by your continued visits to the site. Over the past few years we have developed a lot of content as a result, it is **time to reorganize** it to help be more consise, and to aide users in finding the relevant content easily. Over the next few months you will **notice changes and updates** to the repository, as we **add** additional content, **revise** existing dated content and nomenclature. The **folder structure** and **resources** will be **reorganized** for ease of use, and so that CODE examples and TUTORIALS will be grouped together for ease of use. We hope this will help users to find the content they need in an easier manner.
